      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by handheld gaming devices. The Game Boy, PSP, and Nintendo Switch have all been incredible pieces of technology that let you carry your gaming world in your pocket. After getting into the maker community and learning about Raspberry Pi, I decided to build my own portable retro gaming console.</p>
        <p>This project took about 6 months from initial concept to final build, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had. In this guide, I'll walk you through every step of creating your own handheld retro gaming device.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <strong>What you'll learn:</strong> By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to select components, design a custom case, wire everything together, and set up the software to play thousands of retro games.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="components">
        <h2>Components Needed</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the build, let's go over all the components you'll need. I've tested various options and these are my recommendations:</p>

        <div class="components-list">
          <div class="component-item">
            <h4>Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB)</h4>
            <p>The brain of our device. The Pi 4 offers excellent performance for emulation, capable of running N64, PSP, and even some Dreamcast games smoothly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="component-item">
            <h4>5-inch IPS Display (800x480)</h4>
            <p>A crisp, colorful display that connects via HDMI. The IPS panel ensures good viewing angles for comfortable gaming.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="component-item">
            <h4>Battery Pack (10000mAh)</h4>
            <p>Provides 4-6 hours of gameplay. Make sure it supports 5V/3A output for stable power delivery to the Pi 4.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="component-item">
            <h4>USB Gamepad Controller</h4>
            <p>I used a wired USB controller and harvested its PCB for the buttons. Alternatively, you can use individual tactile switches.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="component-item">
            <h4>3D Printed Case</h4>
            <p>Custom designed in CAD software to house all components. I used Solidworks for the design and printed in PLA.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="component-item">
            <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
            <p>Micro SD card (32GB+), mini HDMI adapter, USB-C cable, heat sinks, small cooling fan, screws, and wires.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="cpu">
        <h2>Choosing the CPU: Raspberry Pi 4</h2>
        <p>The Raspberry Pi 4 was an obvious choice for this project. Here's why:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Processing Power:</strong> The quad-core Cortex-A72 processor handles most retro game emulation with ease</li>
          <li><strong>RAM Options:</strong> 4GB or 8GB variants give you headroom for more demanding emulators</li>
          <li><strong>USB 3.0:</strong> Fast data transfer for ROMs stored on external drives</li>
          <li><strong>Built-in WiFi:</strong> Easy to transfer files and update the system wirelessly</li>
          <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Extensive documentation and active community for troubleshooting</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <strong>⚠ Important:</strong> The Raspberry Pi 4 runs hot, especially during gaming. You'll need proper cooling - I recommend a combination of heat sinks and a small 5V fan.
        </div>

        <p>I went with the 4GB model as it provides the best balance of performance and power consumption for a portable device.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="screen">
        <h2>Selecting a Screen</h2>
        <p>The display is one of the most important components as it directly affects your gaming experience. After testing several options, I settled on a 5-inch IPS display.</p>

        <h3>Key Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> 5 inches offers a good balance between portability and visibility</li>
          <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 800x480 is perfect for retro games which run at low resolutions</li>
          <li><strong>Panel Type:</strong> IPS provides better colors and viewing angles than TN panels</li>
          <li><strong>Connection:</strong> HDMI connection ensures the best compatibility</li>
          <li><strong>Touchscreen:</strong> Optional, but useful for navigation (I didn't include it to save battery)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The display connects directly to the Pi's mini-HDMI port. You'll need a mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter and then connect to the display's HDMI input.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="controls">
        <h2>Gamepad & Controls</h2>
        <p>For controls, I harvested the PCB from a cheap USB gamepad and connected it to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. This gave me:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>D-Pad (Up, Down, Left, Right)</li>
          <li>4 Face Buttons (A, B, X, Y)</li>
          <li>2 Shoulder Buttons (L, R)</li>
          <li>Start and Select buttons</li>
          <li>2 Analog sticks (optional, but great for N64 games)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wiring the Controls</h3>
        <p>The GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi can be configured as input buttons. I used the built-in pull-up resistors and connected each button between its GPIO pin and ground. RetroPie's built-in controller configuration makes it easy to map these buttons.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Test your button wiring before final assembly. Use the <code>gpio readall</code> command to verify each button is being detected correctly.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="case">
        <h2>3D Printed Case Design</h2>
        <p>Designing the case was the most time-consuming part of the project, but also the most creative. I used Solidworks for the CAD design, though Blender or Fusion 360 would work just as well.</p>

        <h3>Design Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Comfortable grip angles based on Nintendo Switch design</li>
          <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Air vents for the cooling fan and heat dissipation</li>
          <li><strong>Access:</strong> Cutouts for USB ports, SD card slot, and charging port</li>
          <li><strong>Button Placement:</strong> Natural thumb positioning for extended play sessions</li>
          <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> Snap-fit design with screw reinforcement for durability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The case was printed in black PLA with 20% infill. Total print time was about 12 hours for both halves. I recommend printing with supports for the button holes and display cutout.</p>
